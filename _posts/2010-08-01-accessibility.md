This is the official accessibility statement for Matt Read, Notes?. If you have any questions or
comments, feel free to [contact me](/about.html#contact).

##Access keys

Most browsers support jumping to specific links by typing keys defined on the web site.  On Windows,
you can press <kbd>ALT</kbd> + an access key; on Macintosh, you can press <kbd>Control</kbd> + an
access key. All pages on this site define the following access keys:

- Access key <kbd>1</kbd> - Home page
- Access key <kbd>2</kbd> - Skip to Main Content
- Access key <kbd>3</kbd> - Archives
- Access key <kbd>5</kbd> - Skip to Main Navigation
- Access key <kbd>7</kbd> - Copyright Statement
- Access key <kbd>9</kbd> - Privacy Policy
- Access key <kbd>0</kbd> - Accessibility statement
- Access key <kbd>u</kbd> - About Page
- Access key <kbd>s</kbd> - Syndication Feed

## Standards compliance

1. All pages on this site is <acronym title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym> <acronym title="triple A">AAA</acronym> approved, complying wih <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/full-checklist.html">all priority 1, 2, and 3 guidelines</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/"><acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>. Again, this is a judgement call; many guidelines are intentionally vague and can not be tested automatically. I have reviewed all the guidelines and believe that all these pages are in compliance.
2. All pages on this site are <a href="http://bobby.watchfire.com/">Section 508 approved</a>, complying with all of the <acronym title="United States">U.S.</acronym> Federal Government <a href="http://www.section508.gov/">Section 508 Guidelines</a>.  Again, a judgement call.  I have reviewed all the guidelines and believe that all these pages are in compliance.
3. All pages on this site <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">validate as <acronym title="hypertext markup language">HTML</acronym> 5</a>.  This is not a judgement call; a program can determine with 100% accuracy whether a page is valid XHTML.  For example, <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fmattread.com%2F">check the home page for XHTML validity</a>.
4. All pages on this site use structured semantic markup. H1 tags are used for the site title, H2 tags are used for main titles, and H3 tags for subtitles. For example, on this page, JAWS users can skip to the next section within the accessibility statement by pressing <kbd>ALT+INSERT+3</kbd>.


## Navigation aids


1. All pages have <tt>rel=previous, next,</tt> and <tt>home</tt> links to aid navigation in
   text-only browsers. Netscape 6 and Mozilla users can also take advantage of this feature by
   selecting the View menu, Show/Hide, Site Navigation Bar, Show Only As Needed (or Show Always).
1. The home page and all archive pages include a search box (access key 4).  Advanced search options
   are currently unavailable.


## Links

1. Many links have title attributes which describe the link in greater detail, unless the text of
   the link already fully describes the target (such as the headline of an article).
1. Links are written to make sense out of context.

## Images

1. All content images used in this site include descriptive <code>ALT</code> attributes.  Purely
   decorative graphics include null <code>ALT</code> attributes.
1. Complex images include <acronym title="long description">LONGDESC</acronym> attributes or inline
   descriptions to explain the significance of each image to non-visual readers.


## Visual design

1. This site uses cascading style sheets for visual layout.
1. This site uses only relative font sizes, compatible with the user-specified "text size" option in
   visual browsers.
1. If your browser or browsing device does not support stylesheets at all, the content of each page
   is still readable.

## Content Rating

This site is <a href="http://www.safesurf.com/inspect/search_url.cfm?URL1=http://www.mattread.com/" title="Adult Supervision Recommended">SafeSurf Rated</a> as "Adult Supervision Recommended". This rating is a judgement call on my part, and to the best of my knowledge is accurate and complies with the <a href="http://www.safesurf.com/">SafeSurf</a> End User License Agreement.
