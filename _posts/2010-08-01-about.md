![Alt text](/images/BigJibby.jpg "A picture of me"){: style="float:right"}
I'm Matt Read, a 29 year old male from Ottawa, Canada. That's the capital of Canada for all you who
don't know that already. I enjoy skateboarding, playing hockey and soccer, and working on my
website.

My favourite TV show of all time is MacGyver, and Good Will Hunting is my favorite movie. I program
in PHP, MySQL, Javascript, and Bash Scripting, and I love playing with Python. I'm a bit pedantic
about producing **semantic** HTML (and no, valid does not mean semantic).
