So I stayed at home Friday and worked on my site. I spent alot of time chatting in #wordpress channel on irc.freenode.net. We were talking about strippers, and a bunch of other weird shit. But I'm glad to tell you that I'm now the dictator of Australia and New Zealand. We will soon be invading &lt;a href="http://www.randywalker.net/aerica/aerica.html"&gt;Aerica&lt;/a&gt;, and overthrowing the UN. After that, on to Canada! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hail, BigJibby&lt;/li&gt;
