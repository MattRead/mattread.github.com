It is important to remember that when you provide personal information (e.g., last name, address, phone number) in a online posting that that information  is visible to anyone, and may be used by someone in a manner unintended by you. For that reason, I discourage you from posting any personal information  on this or any website in comments or otherwise.&#xD;
