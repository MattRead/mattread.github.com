This time I went all out space age with CSS fonts and CSS text effects, like text-shadow and opacity. Inspired mostly by &lt;a href="http://chrisjdavis.org/" title="Sillyness Spelled Wrong Intentionally"&gt;Chris J. Davis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/47293812@N00/4680652414"&gt;&lt;img src="//farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4680652414_9182a5d55e_m.jpg" class="card right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I also went for HTML5, which, obviously, required a little MSIE hack. I found the semantics of HTML5 well thought out; Can&amp;#8217;t wait till it becomes reality, especially the audio/video stuff. Goodbye Flash!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll notice the pinstripe background, which may make it harder to read, but this time I went for beauty over usability. Yes, I committed a sin, don&amp;#8217;t hate me please. I&amp;#8217;ve played with some transparent containers for the content,  but I think it looks better as is. Although, I still have a fluid layout and flexible font sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also implemented a &amp;#8220;notification area&amp;#8221; at the top. Logged out, you will see the extra panes that include the less used stuff, that I would call clutter. Logged in, some additional things appear, like alerts for when you have comments awaiting moderation, etc. Sort of an admin bar built in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get all the code sorted out, and the options pages going, I plan on releasing this revision of the theme. But don&amp;#8217;t hold your breath.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s been up for a while but I just haven&amp;#8217;t took the time to talk about it. My goal in this design was to create a simple, easy to read design without being boring, like so many &amp;#8220;simple&amp;#8221; designs out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also went with a dark background this time, something that prooved harder than it sounds. The dark background In my opinion make it much easier to read on a computer monitor. It also looks &amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;neater&amp;#8221; ;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new &lt;a href="/archives"&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt;, well, they&amp;#8217;re just rockin. I love how they show my &amp;#8220;seasonal&amp;#8221; posting, and I noticed I tend to post very little in the winter months. Must the cold weather. If you like them I can make the code available, just let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still some bugs and improvements to be made, but let me know what you think of &amp;#8220;Version Oceanus&amp;#8221;. If you are using MSIE, I know, it all looks fubar&amp;#8217;ed ;).&lt;/p&gt;
