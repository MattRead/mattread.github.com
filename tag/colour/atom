This time I went for a colourful design using the basics, red, green, blue, violet, and yellow, as you&amp;#8217;ll see in the background. I tried to carry those colours throughout the whole design. The header is a dark violet to try to dull down the &amp;#8220;jump in your face&amp;#8221; colours in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted this design to jump of the page with colour. I tend to design very &amp;#8220;monochromatically&amp;#8221;, so I hope I pulled it off. With a simple layout and bright colours I think I might have achieved something close to what I imagined. Stay tunned, as there will be a few more updates to the &lt;a href="http://drunkenmonkey.org"&gt;Labs&lt;/a&gt; this week as I go through the design and update a few things, and hopefully add even more colour.&lt;/p&gt;
