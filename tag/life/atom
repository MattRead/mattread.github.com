Well being as though FF was kinda slow for me, I tried it out, and HOLLY SHIT! FF is now the fastest browser I have ever used. You gotta go there and do the &lt;a href="http://kentville.blogspot.com/2004/08/myie2-i-just-installed-myie2-on-my.html"&gt;FF tweak&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#8217;ll be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am on Linux and it worked the same way for me. Some of the config values were not there for me, so I just created new ones. Go now! Go on, get outta here!&lt;/p&gt;

So I go inside and theres this little artsie sitting there, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;artsie: &amp;#8220;hi&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: &amp;#8220;hey, hows it going?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  artsie: &amp;#8220;good, what can I do for you?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: &amp;#8220;I need a haircut&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  artsie: &amp;#8220;do you have an appointment?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: &amp;#8220;nope&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  artsie: &amp;#8220;well, you need an appointment to get a haircut&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: &amp;#8220;alright, can I make an appointment?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  artsie: &amp;#8220;sure, when would you like it for?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: &amp;#8220;right now&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  (the artsie pauses, looks at me, looks at his sheet)&lt;br /&gt;
  artsie: &amp;#8220;well, I guess I can fit you in now&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was sitting there waiting and thinking that I&amp;#8217;m never coming back here again, this drop dead gorgeous blond walks out and says &amp;#8220;Matt Read&amp;#8221;. I wipe the drool from my face, close my mouth, and say, &amp;#8220;hee &amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8230; here&amp;#8221;. Man she was hot, I&amp;#8217;ve already made another appointment in two weeks with her. I love that place.&lt;/p&gt;

Back in the day there was this small kid who lived down on sunnyside street, right across from Carleton University. He lived in a shit hole of a house, and he was my friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, we were sitting around smoking a joint, if you don&amp;#8217;t know what a joint is stop here, and he said &amp;#8220;pass the reef stick&amp;#8221;. I looked at him puzzled. He repeated &amp;#8220;the reef stick&amp;#8221; he paused, &amp;#8220;the joint&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;OH&amp;#8221; I said. He referred to a joint as a &amp;#8220;reef stick&amp;#8221; for couple more weeks, then it became &amp;#8220;the party roll&amp;#8221; for a very short time, then about six other nick names. He finally settled on &amp;#8220;Jibby&amp;#8221;, and we all liked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as time went on I noticed that this small kid never had any money or weed of his own. He was always smoking mine. I confronted him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Matt: &amp;#8220;hey, why don&amp;#8217;t you ever buy your own weed?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Kid: &amp;#8220;cause I don&amp;#8217;t have any money.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: &amp;#8220;what about that student loan you got?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Kid: &amp;#8220;I spent it on the beer making machine in the basement.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: &amp;#8220;Oh yah, good beer.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Kid: &amp;#8220;Yah.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  (short pause as we think about the beer.)&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: &amp;#8221; I don&amp;#8217;t think I should give you anymore of my weed, until you pay me back that twenty bucks I loaned you.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Kid: &amp;#8220;ah man, com&amp;#8217;on, I&amp;#8217;l get you the money when I visit my Mom on the weekend.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know, it&amp;#8217;s been awhile now. And you never have any weed.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Kid: &amp;#8220;dude, the Matt Man, the&amp;#8230; Big Jibby, you know I&amp;#8217;m good for it.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: &amp;#8220;yah, I&amp;#8217;m just shitin ya.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from then on I have been called the Big Jibby. Why the Big Jibby? Cause I was always the one with the weed. So that&amp;#8217;s my story of the small kid on sunnyside. (Rock on Jim!)&lt;/p&gt;

On Friday we went out to Broadways in Stittsville, then over to Grace O&amp;#8217;Maleys. they were pretty boring as everyone has gone to the cottage for the weekend. So we went over to O&amp;#8217;Connors in Kanata, again pretty boring and the Band wasn&amp;#8217;t very good. So tonight were going down to the Market to hit some bars down there, and there&amp;#8217;s always Le Pink Panther over in Hull to fall back on. :-P&lt;/p&gt;

I shot a &amp;#8230; well I sucked. Went to the Collenade afterwards and had pizza and beer. I&amp;#8217;m kinds drunk right now so if my engrish is a bit off that&amp;#8217;s why. Anyway there was this twosome behind us, we were a foursome, and they wanted to play through us and we told them NO. If your going to play golf then get four people as the rules of the course say. And if you don&amp;#8217;t have four then don&amp;#8217;t expect to play through any one cause your an idiot. So get four goddamn people to play with and stop fucking complaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more golf news my uncle Peter got a hole in one the other at the Lombard Glen. His friend went first with an eight iron, and went over the green. So Peter switch to a nine iron and landed on the front of the green and it rolled and rolled and BAM, right in the hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and those goddamn teachers, Peter is a retired teacher, are so fucking lucky with their pentions. It&amp;#8217;s like they one the cash for life lottery or something. I think I want to be a teacher, paid a full salary and get four months of. Screw a donkey all you teachers and stop complaining about your salary!!!&lt;/p&gt;

To show to all the villagers her lovely bare white hide; &lt;br /&gt;
The most observant villager, an Engineer of course, &lt;br /&gt;
Was the only one to notice that Godiva rode a horse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chorus:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
We are, we are, we are, we are the Engineers &lt;br /&gt;
We can, we can, we can, we can demolish forty beers. &lt;br /&gt;
Drink rum, drink rum, drink rum, drink rum and come along with us, &lt;br /&gt;
For we don&amp;#8217;t give a damn for any damn man who don&amp;#8217;t give a damn for us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father was a miner in the northern Malamute, &lt;br /&gt;
My mother was a mistress of a house of ill repute, &lt;br /&gt;
The last time I saw the both, these words rang in my ears- &lt;br /&gt;
Get out of here you s.o.b. and join the Engineers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The army and the navy boys went out to have some fun &lt;br /&gt;
Down to the local tavern where the fiery liquors run; &lt;br /&gt;
But all they found were empties for the Engineers had come &lt;br /&gt;
And traded all their instruments for gallon kegs of rum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Francis Drake and all his ships set out for Calais Bay, &lt;br /&gt;
They heard the Spanish rum fleet was heading out that way. &lt;br /&gt;
But the Engineers had beat them by a night and half a day &lt;br /&gt;
And although as drunk as hooligans, you still could hear them say&amp;#8230; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An artsie and an Engineer found a gallon can. &lt;br /&gt;
Said the artise, &amp;#8220;Match me drink for drink and see if you&amp;#8217;re a man.&amp;#8221; &lt;br /&gt;
They took three drinks, the artsie fell, his face was turning green; &lt;br /&gt;
But the Engineer drank on and said, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s only gasoline.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venus is a statue made entirely of stone, &lt;br /&gt;
She didn&amp;#8217;t wear a fig leaf, she was naked as a bone. &lt;br /&gt;
On noticing her arms were gone, an Engineer discoursed, &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;The darned thing&amp;#8217;s busted concrete and should&amp;#8217;ve been reinforced!&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you&amp;#8217;ve heard our story and you know we&amp;#8217;re Engineers. &lt;br /&gt;
We love to love our women and we love to drink our beers. &lt;br /&gt;
So come and have a sip with us, we&amp;#8217;ll drink to anyone from far and near &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8216;Coz we&amp;#8217;re a helluva helluva helluva helluva helluva ENGINEER!!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Husband and Wife are outside one day. the Husband is cooking on the BBQ and the Wife is bent over working in the flower garden. The Husband says to his wife, &amp;#8220;honey your ass is almost as wide as this grill&amp;#8221;. The Wife ignores him. A little while latter, the Husband gets out his measuring tape, measures the grill, measures the Wifes ass, and says, &amp;#8220;Yup just as wide as the grill&amp;#8221;. The Wife ignores him again. Latter that night the husband is fooling around in bed, and the Wife is ignoring him. So the Husband says, &amp;#8220;com&amp;#8217;on honey!&amp;#8221;. The Wife rolls over and says, &amp;#8220;you must be crazy if you think I&amp;#8217;m gonna fire up the grill for a little weiner like that&amp;#8221;.&lt;br /&gt;

You may remember a &lt;a href="http://www.mattread.com/index.php/archives/2004/06/24/free-suse-linux-91-professional/"&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; about free SuSE 9.1 pro I wrote. Well I finally got it in the mail, and now have it installed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing I miss from Mandrake is the MCC (Mandrake Control Center). But YaST (Yet Another Setup Tool) is very good, and detected my sound card and TV card, which Mandrake didn&amp;#8217;t do. I would have to say though, I like SuSE a little better than Mandrake.&lt;/p&gt;

So if you don&amp;#8217;t hear from me in a couple of days I&amp;#8217;m probably lying in a ditch somewhere around Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s the Federal election for all you non Canadians out there. One thing that I like about one of the parties this year, The Green Party, is the fact that they want to legalize Marijuana. I&amp;#8217;m all for that one, but I don&amp;#8217;t really want a bunch of pot heads running our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I hope all you Canadians out there voted. Because if you didn&amp;#8217;t then you can&amp;#8217;t complain, so SHUT YOUR MOUTH BIATCH&lt;/p&gt;
