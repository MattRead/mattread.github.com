My thinking is to &amp;#8220;version&amp;#8221; everything by date. So for example, I could have /blog/post-slug/2007-04-01. There might only be one version of most blog posts, but it would allow for &amp;#8220;follow up&amp;#8221; posts on the same topic at a letter date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second thought is to use the content-type in the URI, /content-type/post-slug/version; Giving something like, /entry/post-slug/2007-04-01, or /page/about/2007-04-01. A URI without the version would simply be the latest version, /page/about. This also lends well to my projects. I would maybe have a content-type of &amp;#8220;project&amp;#8221;, so I could have /project/tabasamu/2007-04-01 etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus I could categorize all content by it&amp;#8217;s type and version, then further by tags. I&amp;#8217;m liking this idea, hopefully I can hack around with Habari a bit and see if I can make it work. Here&amp;#8217;s hoping post-slugs are not unique, as they shouldn&amp;#8217;t be (for my case anyway ;) ).&lt;/p&gt;
