This time I went all out space age with CSS fonts and CSS text effects, like text-shadow and opacity. Inspired mostly by &lt;a href="http://chrisjdavis.org/" title="Sillyness Spelled Wrong Intentionally"&gt;Chris J. Davis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//www.flickr.com/photos/47293812@N00/4680652414"&gt;&lt;img src="//farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4680652414_9182a5d55e_m.jpg" class="card right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I also went for HTML5, which, obviously, required a little MSIE hack. I found the semantics of HTML5 well thought out; Can&amp;#8217;t wait till it becomes reality, especially the audio/video stuff. Goodbye Flash!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll notice the pinstripe background, which may make it harder to read, but this time I went for beauty over usability. Yes, I committed a sin, don&amp;#8217;t hate me please. I&amp;#8217;ve played with some transparent containers for the content,  but I think it looks better as is. Although, I still have a fluid layout and flexible font sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also implemented a &amp;#8220;notification area&amp;#8221; at the top. Logged out, you will see the extra panes that include the less used stuff, that I would call clutter. Logged in, some additional things appear, like alerts for when you have comments awaiting moderation, etc. Sort of an admin bar built in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get all the code sorted out, and the options pages going, I plan on releasing this revision of the theme. But don&amp;#8217;t hold your breath.&lt;/p&gt;
