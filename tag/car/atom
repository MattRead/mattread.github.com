At 300,000 km, I would say it did a pretty good job for me. And at this point, It&amp;#8217;s not worth spending the $800 to get fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;m on the hunt for a small truck. A Ford Ranger would be perfect, and would be my ideal vehicle. But a Mini Van has come for $2,500 and I&amp;#8217;m seriously considering it. I &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; thought I would consider buying a mini van. But if you think about, it gets better gas mileage than the truck, can carry pretty much anything the small truck could, and I can put a hitch on it to pull a trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#8217;t want to be a &amp;#8220;Soccer Mom&amp;#8221;, so I think I&amp;#8217;ll be sticking with a small truck. I got a line on a Chevy S-10 in my price range. I&amp;#8217;ll let you know what I decide.&lt;/p&gt;
