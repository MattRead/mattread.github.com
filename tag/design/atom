The new PHP pastebin on the block, based on the OSS code from &lt;a href="pastebin.com"&gt;Pastebin.com&lt;/a&gt;. The entire systme and codebase was almost completely rewritten by Jim, in aim of simplifying the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://jimwhimpey.com/blog/2007/pasteosaurus-and-an-incredible-photographic-journal/"&gt;Jim says&lt;/a&gt; on his blog, &lt;q cite="http://jimwhimpey.com/blog/2007/pasteosaurus-and-an-incredible-photographic-journal/"&gt;Every piece of junk I wasn&#x2019;t using from pastebin has been removed, including DB fields and every file has been reorganised and rewritten in cleaner, smaller and more easily read code. This means it&#x2019;s now much easier for me to add features, which I&#x2019;ve already done!&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite a lovely pastebin, much faster and cleaner than most of those other big ones. The design is simple yet beautiful; I love to see red and pink in a design. And with the use of &lt;a href="http://geshi.org/"&gt;Geshi&lt;/a&gt;, the syntax highlighting works quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, being a good OSS citizen, the code available for download via the link at the bottom of every page. So let&amp;#8217;s not pastebin anymore, let&amp;#8217;s Pasteosaurus!&lt;/p&gt;

This time I went for a colourful design using the basics, red, green, blue, violet, and yellow, as you&amp;#8217;ll see in the background. I tried to carry those colours throughout the whole design. The header is a dark violet to try to dull down the &amp;#8220;jump in your face&amp;#8221; colours in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted this design to jump of the page with colour. I tend to design very &amp;#8220;monochromatically&amp;#8221;, so I hope I pulled it off. With a simple layout and bright colours I think I might have achieved something close to what I imagined. Stay tunned, as there will be a few more updates to the &lt;a href="http://drunkenmonkey.org"&gt;Labs&lt;/a&gt; this week as I go through the design and update a few things, and hopefully add even more colour.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s been up for a while but I just haven&amp;#8217;t took the time to talk about it. My goal in this design was to create a simple, easy to read design without being boring, like so many &amp;#8220;simple&amp;#8221; designs out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also went with a dark background this time, something that prooved harder than it sounds. The dark background In my opinion make it much easier to read on a computer monitor. It also looks &amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;neater&amp;#8221; ;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new &lt;a href="/archives"&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt;, well, they&amp;#8217;re just rockin. I love how they show my &amp;#8220;seasonal&amp;#8221; posting, and I noticed I tend to post very little in the winter months. Must the cold weather. If you like them I can make the code available, just let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still some bugs and improvements to be made, but let me know what you think of &amp;#8220;Version Oceanus&amp;#8221;. If you are using MSIE, I know, it all looks fubar&amp;#8217;ed ;).&lt;/p&gt;

My thinking is to &amp;#8220;version&amp;#8221; everything by date. So for example, I could have /blog/post-slug/2007-04-01. There might only be one version of most blog posts, but it would allow for &amp;#8220;follow up&amp;#8221; posts on the same topic at a letter date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second thought is to use the content-type in the URI, /content-type/post-slug/version; Giving something like, /entry/post-slug/2007-04-01, or /page/about/2007-04-01. A URI without the version would simply be the latest version, /page/about. This also lends well to my projects. I would maybe have a content-type of &amp;#8220;project&amp;#8221;, so I could have /project/tabasamu/2007-04-01 etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus I could categorize all content by it&amp;#8217;s type and version, then further by tags. I&amp;#8217;m liking this idea, hopefully I can hack around with Habari a bit and see if I can make it work. Here&amp;#8217;s hoping post-slugs are not unique, as they shouldn&amp;#8217;t be (for my case anyway ;) ).&lt;/p&gt;
