To show to all the villagers her lovely bare white hide; &lt;br /&gt;
The most observant villager, an Engineer of course, &lt;br /&gt;
Was the only one to notice that Godiva rode a horse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chorus:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
We are, we are, we are, we are the Engineers &lt;br /&gt;
We can, we can, we can, we can demolish forty beers. &lt;br /&gt;
Drink rum, drink rum, drink rum, drink rum and come along with us, &lt;br /&gt;
For we don't give a damn for any damn man who don't give a damn for us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father was a miner in the northern Malamute, &lt;br /&gt;
My mother was a mistress of a house of ill repute, &lt;br /&gt;
The last time I saw the both, these words rang in my ears- &lt;br /&gt;
Get out of here you s.o.b. and join the Engineers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The army and the navy boys went out to have some fun &lt;br /&gt;
Down to the local tavern where the fiery liquors run; &lt;br /&gt;
But all they found were empties for the Engineers had come &lt;br /&gt;
And traded all their instruments for gallon kegs of rum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Francis Drake and all his ships set out for Calais Bay, &lt;br /&gt;
They heard the Spanish rum fleet was heading out that way. &lt;br /&gt;
But the Engineers had beat them by a night and half a day &lt;br /&gt;
And although as drunk as hooligans, you still could hear them say... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An artsie and an Engineer found a gallon can. &lt;br /&gt;
Said the artise, "Match me drink for drink and see if you're a man." &lt;br /&gt;
They took three drinks, the artsie fell, his face was turning green; &lt;br /&gt;
But the Engineer drank on and said, "It's only gasoline." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venus is a statue made entirely of stone, &lt;br /&gt;
She didn't wear a fig leaf, she was naked as a bone. &lt;br /&gt;
On noticing her arms were gone, an Engineer discoursed, &lt;br /&gt;
"The darned thing's busted concrete and should've been reinforced!" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you've heard our story and you know we're Engineers. &lt;br /&gt;
We love to love our women and we love to drink our beers. &lt;br /&gt;
So come and have a sip with us, we'll drink to anyone from far and near &lt;br /&gt;
'Coz we're a helluva helluva helluva helluva helluva ENGINEER!!! &lt;/p&gt;
