Aside from not opening the gates until 7:00 for a 7:30 show, making us wait outside in the cold, it was one of the best shows I've ever seen. From the midgets opening up the show to the strippers repelling down from the ceiling, it was all wicked cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One complaint I have though, is the price of beer. $24 for four beers is fucking ridiculous. I mean really, com'on, your ripping us off you corporate bitches. But if you can afford to, I highly recommend going to see the Crew when they &lt;a href="http://www.motleycrue.com/tour/"&gt;come your way&lt;/a&gt;. Kick ass show!&lt;/p&gt;
