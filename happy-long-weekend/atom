On Friday we went out to Broadways in Stittsville, then over to Grace O'Maleys. they were pretty boring as everyone has gone to the cottage for the weekend. So we went over to O'Connors in Kanata, again pretty boring and the Band wasn't very good. So tonight were going down to the Market to hit some bars down there, and there's always Le Pink Panther over in Hull to fall back on. :-P&lt;/p&gt;
