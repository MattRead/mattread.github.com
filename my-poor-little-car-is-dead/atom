At 300,000 km, I would say it did a pretty good job for me. And at this point, It's not worth spending the $800 to get fixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
So, I'm on the hunt for a small truck. A Ford Ranger would be perfect, and would be my ideal vehicle. But a Mini Van has come for $2,500 and I'm seriously considering it. I **never** thought I would consider buying a mini van. But if you think about, it gets better gas mileage than the truck, can carry pretty much anything the small truck could, and I can put a hitch on it to pull a trailer.&#xD;
&#xD;
But I don't want to be a "Soccer Mom", so I think I'll be sticking with a small truck. I got a line on a Chevy S-10 in my price range. I'll let you know what I decide.</content></entry>
