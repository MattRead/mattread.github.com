I just got an invite to &lt;a href="http://gmail.google.com/" rel="external"&gt;GMail&lt;/a&gt;, Google's new email service with 1 GB of storage. I don't know how I'm ever going to use up that much space, but I guess I'll never have to delete email again. I haven't had much time to play with it yet, but I plan on telling you all about it so stay tuned. Goodbye Yahoo, hello GMail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big problem I have with it already, is that they don't support Konqueror. I know that it is still in the testing stage, but I would really like to see them support Konqueror. At least they support Firefox&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Kenneth for the invite (&lt;a href="http://kentville.blogspot.com/" rel="external"&gt;KentVille&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
