So I go inside and theres this little artsie sitting there, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;artsie: "hi"&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: "hey, hows it going?"&lt;br /&gt;
  artsie: "good, what can I do for you?"&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: "I need a haircut"&lt;br /&gt;
  artsie: "do you have an appointment?"&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: "nope"&lt;br /&gt;
  artsie: "well, you need an appointment to get a haircut"&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: "alright, can I make an appointment?"&lt;br /&gt;
  artsie: "sure, when would you like it for?"&lt;br /&gt;
  Matt: "right now"&lt;br /&gt;
  (the artsie pauses, looks at me, looks at his sheet)&lt;br /&gt;
  artsie: "well, I guess I can fit you in now"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was sitting there waiting and thinking that I'm never coming back here again, this drop dead gorgeous blond walks out and says "Matt Read". I wipe the drool from my face, close my mouth, and say, "hee ... &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; ... here". Man she was hot, I've already made another appointment in two weeks with her. I love that place.&lt;/p&gt;
