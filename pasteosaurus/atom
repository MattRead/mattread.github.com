The new PHP pastebin on the block, based on the OSS code from &lt;a href="pastebin.com"&gt;Pastebin.com&lt;/a&gt;. The entire systme and codebase was almost completely rewritten by Jim, in aim of simplifying the entire system.&#xD;
&#xD;
As &lt;a href="http://jimwhimpey.com/blog/2007/pasteosaurus-and-an-incredible-photographic-journal/"&gt;Jim says&lt;/a&gt; on his blog, &lt;q cite="http://jimwhimpey.com/blog/2007/pasteosaurus-and-an-incredible-photographic-journal/"&gt;Every piece of junk I wasn&#x2019;t using from pastebin has been removed, including DB fields and every file has been reorganised and rewritten in cleaner, smaller and more easily read code. This means it&#x2019;s now much easier for me to add features, which I&#x2019;ve already done!&lt;/q&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
It is quite a lovely pastebin, much faster and cleaner than most of those other big ones. The design is simple yet beautiful; I love to see red and pink in a design. And with the use of &lt;a href="http://geshi.org/"&gt;Geshi&lt;/a&gt;, the syntax highlighting works quite well.&#xD;
&#xD;
Of course, being a good OSS citizen, the code available for download via the link at the bottom of every page. So let's not pastebin anymore, let's Pasteosaurus!</content></entry>
