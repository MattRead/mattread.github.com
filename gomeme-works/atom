Up from 23 two days ago. I don't know if it has any thing to do with GoMeme, but that's a significant jump in standings in a few days. I have done nothing much else in that period of time, so it looks like GoMeme may be doing something for me. Stay tunned and we'll see how high I go, &lt;q&gt;one of these days I will rule all you plebs.... did I say that out loud?&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm now up to number 4. When I make number 1, I will declare victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; I am THE Matt Read now. That's right I'm now number one in the world on google (at least at the time of writing this update). I guess maybe this GoMeme thing does work. Now on to take over the number one Matt in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
