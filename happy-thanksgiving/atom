For all who don't know, the Canadian Thanksgiving is to give thanks for a successful harvest. Unlike the  American tradition of remembering Pilgrims and settling in the New World. The reason for the earlier celebration, is the simple fact that Canada is further north and the harvest comes earlier than the States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Canadian Thanksgiving was first held over 40 years before the pilgrims landed in Massachusetts. In 1957, the Canadian Parliament announced that on the second Monday in October Thanksgiving would be &lt;q&gt;a day of general thanksgiving to almighty God for the bountiful harvest with which Canada has been blessed.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do we eat here in Canada? I have always had Turkey dinner with potatoes, carrots and much more. But some people say that the original feasts usually featured venison and waterfowl. And of coarse we always has pumpkin pie. Mm mm, my Mom's home made pumpkin pie, there's nothing better. Well maybe the turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
