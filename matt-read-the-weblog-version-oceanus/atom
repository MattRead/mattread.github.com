It's been up for a while but I just haven't took the time to talk about it. My goal in this design was to create a simple, easy to read design without being boring, like so many "simple" designs out there.&#xD;
&#xD;
I also went with a dark background this time, something that prooved harder than it sounds. The dark background In my opinion make it much easier to read on a computer monitor. It also looks ... "neater" ;).&#xD;
&#xD;
My new &lt;a href="/archives"&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt;, well, they're just rockin. I love how they show my "seasonal" posting, and I noticed I tend to post very little in the winter months. Must the cold weather. If you like them I can make the code available, just let me know.&#xD;
&#xD;
There are still some bugs and improvements to be made, but let me know what you think of "Version Oceanus". If you are using MSIE, I know, it all looks fubar'ed ;).</content></entry>
