I always do my own oil changes, but this was the first time I've done brakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The brakes were actually extremely simple to do, assuming you have the right tools, which I did. You just remove the wheel, take the caliper off, and clip on the new pads. After cleaning and greasing the contact surfaces, of course. The rotors stumped me though. Luckily a quick call to my brother solved that. You just hammer them of and slide the new ones on. Bolt it all together, et voila, new brakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;So for about $100 CAD I have brand new, Premium, brakes. Now for some new tires. ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry>
