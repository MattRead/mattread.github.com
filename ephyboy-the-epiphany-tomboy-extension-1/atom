It&#xD;
allowed you to create a new [Tomboy][] note using the currently selected text of the webpage you&#xD;
were browsing, using the title for the title of the note and referencing the url as the source. This&#xD;
was great for me to document all the code and Linux commands I'd find scattered around the net.&#xD;
&#xD;
Eventually, though, I got tired of [Firefox][], especially it's load times, and switched to&#xD;
[Chromium][]. You guessed it, [Chromium][] sucked too. So back to [Epiphany][] I went, and with the&#xD;
2.30 version it is really quite a nice little browser.&#xD;
&#xD;
[Epiphany][] extensions are now done with [Seed][], the GTK javascript bindings, making it really&#xD;
easy to write new extensions. Plus, it has almost a complete GTK implementation via GObject&#xD;
Introspection. So getting my tomboy note maker dohicky back was really not that hard --aside from&#xD;
the lack of documentation. And thus, [Ephyboy][] is born. It's really quite simple:&#xD;
&#xD;
 1. [Download][] the tarball, or zip.&#xD;
 2. [Install][] the extension.&#xD;
 3. Enable the extension (*no restart required!*).&#xD;
 4. Select some text to add in your note.&#xD;
 5. Hit &lt;kbd&gt;CTRL+Shift+B&lt;/kbd&gt;; Or, add the Tomboy Note button to the toolbar and click the button.&#xD;
&#xD;
The extension will then create your note and open your note in [Tomboy][] for review and/or further&#xD;
editing.&#xD;
&#xD;
There is one thing to note. The extension works by making a DBus call to Tomboy to create the note&#xD;
so you have to have Tomboy open and connected to the bus for this to work. Usually not a problem&#xD;
as I have Tomboy start on log in.&#xD;
