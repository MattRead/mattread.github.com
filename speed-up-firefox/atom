Well being as though FF was kinda slow for me, I tried it out, and HOLLY SHIT! FF is now the fastest browser I have ever used. You gotta go there and do the &lt;a href="http://kentville.blogspot.com/2004/08/myie2-i-just-installed-myie2-on-my.html"&gt;FF tweak&lt;/a&gt;, you'll be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am on Linux and it worked the same way for me. Some of the config values were not there for me, so I just created new ones. Go now! Go on, get outta here!&lt;/p&gt;
