From an Email I received:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. It's legal to play hockey professionally.&#xD;
2. The puck is always hard.&#xD;
3. Protective equipment is reusable and you don't even have to wash it.&#xD;
4. It lasts a full hour.&#xD;
5. You know you're finished when the buzzer sounds.&#xD;
6. Your parents cheer when you score.&#xD;
7. Periods only last 20 minutes.&#xD;
8. You can count on it at least twice a week.&#xD;
9. You can tell your friends about it afterwards.&#xD;
10. A two-on-one or three-on-one is not uncommon.</content></entry>
