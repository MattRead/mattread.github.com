This morning on the &lt;a href="http://chez106.com/"&gt;Chez106&lt;/a&gt; morning show, a local radio station in Ottawa, Doc and Woody, the DJ's, were talking about cornholing. It turns there is a Cornholing league down in the USA somewhere, and Doc and Woody where cornholing on air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have been doing this battle of the neighbourhood thing, where too families are asked trivia questions, and the winner wins a trip somewhere. And today was the final segment, so they held it at the &lt;a href="http://www.cheo.on.ca/"&gt;CHEO&lt;/a&gt; Dream House. The &lt;a href="http://www.dreamofalifetime.ca/grandPrize_e.html"&gt;CHEO Dream House&lt;/a&gt; is a 1.2 million dollar house that is given away as top prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.dreamofalifetime.ca/index_e.html"&gt;CHEO Dream of a Lifetime Lottery&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, if you win, the house comes with $50,000.00 cash, a $40,000.00 car, groceries for a year, fully furnished, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, they had a cornholing competition between Eric The Intern and Dave Smith, and the people that showed up. Man, that Eric The Intern will do anything. I'm not sure who won though. Oh, and they had &lt;a href="http://tfband.com/"&gt;Trevor Finlay&lt;/a&gt; playing live on air too, as he does every week for the battle of the neighbourhood. It was all pretty funny as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And before you ask what cornholing is; it's a game where you try to throw beanbags through holes in a board, each hole worth a certain amount of points. Why cornholing? you ask. Well, back in the day they used to fill their beanbags with corn, and they threw them through holes, hence the name "Cornholing". And you thought it meant something else, you pig.&lt;/p&gt;
