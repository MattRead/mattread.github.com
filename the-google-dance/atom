I was 10, 12, 10, 2, 1, 2, 1, etc. and was wondering just how google decided the standings. I came accross &lt;a href="http://www.mcdar.net/dance/index.php"&gt;Google Datacenter Watch Tool&lt;/a&gt; a site that compares a bunch of Google datacenters. It's neet to see how the results differ throughout the day and on each server. Very interesting, have a look, you may not show up where you thought you did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In similar News I came accross &lt;a href="http://www.flyte.biz/resources/newsletters/03/12.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about the real Google Dance. It seems Google likes to screw with its algorithm on a regular basis, it's been dubbed &lt;q&gt;the Google dance&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder why Google standings are soo important, well have a look at &lt;a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1038-5182000.html?tag=cd.hed"&gt;this article on C|Net&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see why. Google has 41% of the market, followed by Yahoo! with 27% and MSN with 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
