Well, it changed. As you may have noticed I no longer run &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. I'm now running &lt;a href="http://habariproject.org"&gt;Habari&lt;/a&gt; on this site. It's not because Habari is better than WordPress, but simply because I got bored of WordPress and Habari offered a new code base for me to play with. I still highly recomend and support the WordPress project.&#xD;
&#xD;
You will also notice that all my current &lt;a href="/projects"&gt;WordPress plugins and themes&lt;/a&gt; are no longer supported. Since I won't be keeping up with WordPress anymore I can no longer support them. If you wish to take them on yourself and develop them further, please send me an email, and I'll link them to your site.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally I would like to say thank you to the WordPress team and community. It has been a great 4 years. I'll miss all the Press ;).</content></entry>
