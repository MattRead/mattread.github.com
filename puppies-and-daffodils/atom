I said to the daffodil, "hello little daffodil". To my shagrin, the daffodil did not reply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I continued to ponder at why the daffodil did not respond, when it hit me. I left my watch in the trunk of the car after golf last month. I had been looking for it for quite some time now. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;"But why won't this damned daffodil respond?", I asked myself, again. As the sun shone beautifully upon the rose coloured daffodil, like a brit drinking tea, it all made sense. I was eating puppies and talking to daffodils, a feet not matched to this day, by even the greatest of super heros.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;Tommorrow I shall save the world from those evil bastards!!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry>
