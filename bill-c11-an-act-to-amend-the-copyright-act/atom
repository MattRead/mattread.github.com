Basically it is a Canadian version of the American's &lt;abbr title="Digital Millenium Copyright Act"&gt;DMCA&lt;/abbr&gt;. Should this bill pass it would make me a pirate for copying all my CD's into &lt;abbr title="Free Loseless Audio Codec"&gt;FLAC&lt;/abbr&gt; files on my computer; Not only that, but anyone who circumvented "digital locks" to make copies for personal use would be breaking the law.&#xD;
&#xD;
So on Linux watching a DVD using the free decoding libraries (libdvdcss2) you would be performing a criminal act. Many of you don't know this, but if you watch a DVD on your computer you paid royalties to the movie industry to do so when you bought your DVD player software. Furthermore, if you use free ones, like [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ "Video Lan Player"), you would now be breaking the law and would be prosecuted in Criminal Court.&#xD;

It's good to see at least the [NDP](http://www.ndp.ca/ "New Democrat Party") is taking a stance against this specific part of the Bill, and is actually, it seams, listening to the &lt;strong&gt;people&lt;/strong&gt;. Too bad they form a minority in the House of Commons. Here is their response:&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;blockquote cite="Nycole.Turmel@parl.gc.ca"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to write regarding Bill C-11, An Act to amend&#xD;
the Copyright Act. We appreciate having the benefit of your comments and the&#xD;
opportunity to let you know more about our work on a number of these&#xD;
legislative concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;New Democrats want updated copyright laws to balance the rights of artists,&#xD;
consumers and rights-holders. We believe that Canada needs effective&#xD;
legislation to ensure artists&#x2019; royalties are protected; long-distance&#xD;
education opportunities aren&#x2019;t hindered; and that young people aren&#x2019;t&#xD;
subject to unfair, expensive fines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x2019;s why we will not be supporting Bill C-11 unless the government is&#xD;
willing to amend the digital lock provisions and restore royalty provisions&#xD;
for artists. The blanket provisions for digital locks will allow corporate&#xD;
interests to decide what legal rights you may or may not exercise. This&#xD;
unbalanced approach will ultimately hurt artists, educators and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;New Democrats also think that it is time to strike a balance in Canada&#x2019;s&#xD;
copyright law that will properly recognize the cultural community for its&#xD;
valuable contributions to our society. Going forward, we will continue to&#xD;
work hard to improve this bill and press the Harper government to adopt the&#xD;
best copyright laws for the 21st century. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Please find below a letter from NDP Copyright and Digital Issues critic&#xD;
Charlie Angus that further explains our position on Bill C-11.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Again, thank you for taking the time to register your views.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Nycole Turmel, M.P.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Interim Leader of the Official Opposition&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
New Democratic Party of Canada&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
