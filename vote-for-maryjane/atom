It's the Federal election for all you non Canadians out there. One thing that I like about one of the parties this year, The Green Party, is the fact that they want to legalize Marijuana. I'm all for that one, but I don't really want a bunch of pot heads running our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I hope all you Canadians out there voted. Because if you didn't then you can't complain, so SHUT YOUR MOUTH BIATCH&lt;/p&gt;
