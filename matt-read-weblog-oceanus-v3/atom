This time I went all out space age with CSS fonts and CSS text effects, like text-shadow and opacity. Inspired mostly by [Chris J. Davis](http://chrisjdavis.org/ "Sillyness Spelled Wrong Intentionally").&#xD;

I found the semantics of HTML5 well thought out; Can't wait till it becomes reality, especially the audio/video stuff. Goodbye Flash!&#xD;
&#xD;
You'll notice the pinstripe background, which may make it harder to read, but this time I went for beauty over usability. Yes, I committed a sin, don't hate me please. I've played with some transparent containers for the content,  but I think it looks better as is. Although, I still have a fluid layout and flexible font sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
I've also implemented a "notification area" at the top. Logged out, you will see the extra panes that include the less used stuff, that I would call clutter. Logged in, some additional things appear, like alerts for when you have comments awaiting moderation, etc. Sort of an admin bar built in.&#xD;
&#xD;
When I get all the code sorted out, and the options pages going, I plan on releasing this revision of the theme. But don't hold your breath.</content></entry>
