You may remember a &lt;a href="http://www.mattread.com/index.php/archives/2004/06/24/free-suse-linux-91-professional/"&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; about free SuSE 9.1 pro I wrote. Well I finally got it in the mail, and now have it installed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing I miss from Mandrake is the MCC (Mandrake Control Center). But YaST (Yet Another Setup Tool) is very good, and detected my sound card and TV card, which Mandrake didn't do. I would have to say though, I like SuSE a little better than Mandrake.&lt;/p&gt;
