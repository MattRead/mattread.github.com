To my enjoyment, everything was fine. So I went on with my day, did some work, chatted in #wordpress, played with BotJibby, and dreamed of being at home in bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After work I went home, had dinner, and sat down in front of my computer. The site looked fine and.... wait, no it didn't, I had 8 comments on my most recent post, 9 on the next, 11 on the one after that and so on. To my disgust, it was spam and lots of it. In total their was 665 spam comments.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's see, the last time I checked my site at work was about 1:30PM and by the time I got home and checked it, it was about 7:00PM. That's 665 spams in about 5 hours. Man, I must be famous or something. (prolly more,"or something"). The amazing thing, they were all from the online-casino-poker thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was I gonna do? I talked to &lt;a href="http://www.unknowngenius.com/blog/"&gt;drDave&lt;/a&gt; in #wordpress and first thing I did was install his most excellent plugin, "&lt;a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/archives/2004/11/19/spam-karma-merciless-spam-killing-machine/"&gt;Spam Karma&lt;/a&gt;". After that we worked up a MySQL query to select all of the spam comments, luckily there were no valid comments in between them, and used PHPmyAdmin to delete them all. So, about 15 minutes after installing Spam Karma and deleting the spam, I check the Spam Karma page, and amazingly, in that 15 minutes, &lt;a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/archives/2004/11/19/spam-karma-merciless-spam-killing-machine/"&gt;Spam Karma&lt;/a&gt; had already blocked and deleted 48 spam comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I'm back on track, wasted a night on spam, and have the absolutely superb &lt;a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/archives/2004/11/19/spam-karma-merciless-spam-killing-machine/"&gt;Spam Karma&lt;/a&gt; installed. I have a message for all you spammers out there, and that online-casino-poker thing, &lt;b&gt;FUCK OFF!!!!! FUCK THE HELL RIGHT OFF!!!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one more thing, go get &lt;a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/archives/2004/11/19/spam-karma-merciless-spam-killing-machine/"&gt;Spam Karma&lt;/a&gt;! It's sure to at least get you laid. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
