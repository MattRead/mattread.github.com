The Federal Government workers, well some of them, went on strike today cause they want more money or something. Anyway, being in the Capital of Canada means a lot of people are on strike blocking roads and trying to intimidate people who are trying to get into buildings. I say, if you block traffic or buildings you should be beaten with a stick, a big stick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but you have no right to interfere with public access, in anyway. I do agree you have the right to strike and voice your opinion, but blocking traffic and making it a nightmare to get to work in the morning is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government workers are lazy bastards though. Case in point, the Industry Canada building mail room. Every time I go in there to pick up an incorporation, there's two guys playing cards, one guy listening to his walkman, to women talking to each other, and one on the phone. And sometimes I'll be there twice a day, and they're always doing the same thing. Maybe I'm just jealous at the lack of effort required or the huge pension when they retire, but com'on guys your being paid by me, and my HARD EARNED money. So do some fucking work, and stop complaining, you LAZY ASS BASTARDS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't even start on those teachers, 4 months off, the biggest pension ever, a full-time salary, and you still goddamn complain about too much work and not enough money. Well there I go again, ok that's enough, I made my point, Government workers are FUCKING LAZY!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, alright, there are some very hard working government workers out there. But for the most part there lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
