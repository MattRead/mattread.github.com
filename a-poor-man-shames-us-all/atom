We must give to those who need it, for a poor man shames us all" -- An elder of the Gabra, a pastoral tribe of nomads in Kenya&#xD;
&#xD;
In our culture, North America and many other places, things have become more important than people. We now live in a world of strangers and riches.&#xD;
&#xD;
There was a man in the deserts of Kenya, where they depend on camels for life. He had lost all but two camels do to drought, and would most likely have died, so he asked his neighbour, a stranger, for help. His neighbour gave him a camel even though they too lost many to the drought. Now think about all the homeless living in the street, how many times have you helped them? How many camels have you given?&#xD;
&#xD;
The Camel really symbolizes the relationship of the two people, and the new bond they now share. A rich man is not measured by the things he owns, but by the relationships he has made.&#xD;

&#x201C;I am given love at the price of all else, so I give to be rich&#x201D; -- Weyewa proverb</content></entry>
