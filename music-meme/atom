She threatened me to do it so I thought I better do it. I beleive it went something like, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[BigJibby]&lt;/b&gt; do I have to do this?&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;[chrys_seren]&lt;/b&gt; yes you do, or I will destroy you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[It didn't really go like that, and now I'm being sued by the French government for slander.  No, I'm not really being sued by the French government, and I made all this up.  By all this I mean the IRC chat thing.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here it is. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. How many music files are there on your computer?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, being on dial-up I don't download many files, and seeing as though my old windows drive died, and I lost all my ripped CD's, I only have a total of 69 songs. Thanks to &lt;a href="http://serendipity.lascribe.net/"&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; for showing me the command &lt;code&gt;find /home/matt -name '*flac' | wc -l&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Last CD you bought?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God damn! the hell if I know. But I believe it was ... oh wait I know what it was, NOFX, The Greatest Songs Ever Written. When this album was release the recording company added "by us" to the end of that title for who knows why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. What is the song you last listened to before reading this message?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was playing The Rocky Road to Dublin by Dropkick Murphys on Sing Loud, Sing Proud!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Five songs you often listen to or which mean a lot to you?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penny Lane by the Beatles would be the first just because it's such a beautiful song. number two would be The Rocky Road to Dublin by Dropkick Murphys, kick ass song to get you goin'. The I would say Lenoleum by NOFX, I Wanna Live by the Ramones, and Sing Out by Cat Stevens, the best song Cat Stevens ever did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Who are you going to pass this on to and why?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will pass this on to &lt;a href="http://a.trendyname.org/"&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; just to bug him. and to &lt;a href="http://randywalker.net/"&gt;Randy Walker&lt;/a&gt;, just cause. Oh, and how 'bout &lt;a href="http://www.geeksmakemehot.com/"&gt;Jenn&lt;/a&gt; as well, cause she's got an audioscrobbler account, so she must like music.&lt;/p&gt;
