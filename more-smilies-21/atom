There are a couple of bug fixes in this release, as well as some performance improvements. Mainly I removed the sorting of the smilies arrays, which can be rather large. This also addresses the issue that people had while trying to customize the sorting of there smiley packages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;This version also adds a few more default smiley packages for a grand total of 11 choices, thanks to all those smiley package creators out there. And remember I'm always looking for new packages, so &lt;a href="/contact"&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; if you have some.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry>
