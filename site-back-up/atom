But my host upgraded their server and my site was down a couple of hours. They also changed the path of my site from /home/ to /home2/ so I had to change a few things. If you see any errors please email me or comment on this post. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also implemented mod_rewrite permalinks so any current links you have back to my site, may not work properly. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
