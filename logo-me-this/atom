So instead of doing it myself I thought I'd ask for help from you all out there. And so begin Matt's Googly Logo Search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;There really are no rules for the logo, other than the colour scheme you see here on my site. Simplicity is always better, and I like roundish simple logos. So If you have an urge to design a logo for free for some guy from the north, then please do so, eh. ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;You can enter your ... entry, by leaving a comment on this post with a link to your logo design. I will also let you guys vote for the best logo, so If you see a logo you like, leave a comment. The logo with the most votes will become my new identity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks kindly in advance to all those who participated&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry>
