Back in the day there was this small kid who lived down on sunnyside street, right across from Carleton University. He lived in a shit hole of a house, and he was my friend. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;One day, we were sitting around smoking a joint, if you don't know what a joint is stop here, and he said "pass the reef stick". I looked at him puzzled. He repeated "the reef stick" he paused, "the joint". "OH" I said. He referred to a joint as a "reef stick" for couple more weeks, then it became "the party roll" for a very short time, then about six other nick names. He finally settled on "Jibby", and we all liked it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;So as time went on I noticed that this small kid never had any money or weed of his own. He was always smoking mine. I confronted him:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
  &lt;p&gt;Matt: "hey, why don't you ever buy your own weed?"&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
  Kid: "cause I don't have any money."&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
  Matt: "what about that student loan you got?"&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
  Kid: "I spent it on the beer making machine in the basement."&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
  Matt: "Oh yah, good beer."&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
  Kid: "Yah."&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
  (short pause as we think about the beer.)&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
  Matt: " I don't think I should give you anymore of my weed, until you pay me back that twenty bucks I loaned you."&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
  Kid: "ah man, com'on, I'l get you the money when I visit my Mom on the weekend."&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
  Matt: "I don't know, it's been awhile now. And you never have any weed."&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
  Kid: "dude, the Matt Man, the... Big Jibby, you know I'm good for it."&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
  Matt: "yah, I'm just shitin ya."&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;And from then on I have been called the Big Jibby. Why the Big Jibby? Cause I was always the one with the weed. So that's my story of the small kid on sunnyside. (Rock on Jim!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
