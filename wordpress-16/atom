The upgrade went ... decent. I had to do some database manipulation as WordPress didn't give the admin user any capabilities after the upgrade. But other than that it was quite smooth. I even took the time to clear all the spam comments, 668 of them, and freed up about 80KB.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;All my plugins seem to be working well. We'll see how well 1.6 behaves with &lt;a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/"&gt;Spam Karma 2&lt;/a&gt; in the coming days. And I'll be coding upgrades for all my plugins. (I have some really wick ideas for &lt;a href="/projects/x-dashboard/"&gt;X-Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;). I will also do up a complete review of the admin section in the next few days, because it's really a thing of beauty!&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p class="note"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; download of all plugins on this site is currently down, do to the upgrading in progress. Please see &lt;a href="/wp-content/dropbox/"&gt;the dropbox&lt;/a&gt; for all files.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry>
