It was for cheap web hosting. This forum was put up for WORDPRESS help and here is this retard posting ads. I and many others participate on the forums and spend lots of time trying to help others and get help, and it's just selfish and greedy to post ads on a forum like that. Anyone that would SPAM like that should be taken out back and beatten for a day. Actually let's just give them a gun and a helmet and send them over to Iraq to get killed. That seems to be all were doing over there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in conclusion, if your a spammer, FUCK THE HELL RIGHT OFF, EH! YA STUPID POT LICKER!&lt;/p&gt;
