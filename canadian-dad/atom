It's a new site [about his life as a Dad](http://canadiandad.com/about-me/ "About Canadian Dad"). He definately does more blogging than me, so I thought I would link him a bit. He's going to be doing [reviews ](http://canadiandad.com/category/httpcanadiandad-comreviewsgiveaways/ "Candian Dad Reviews")and [giveaways](http://canadiandad.com/category/httpcanadiandad-comreviewsgiveaways-2/ "Canadian Dad Giveaways"). Apparently he's got some products coming up, for free, to review then give away. There is already a chance to win a [$25 Gift Certificate from Marks](http://canadiandad.com/win-a-25-marks-work-warehouse-gift-card/).&#xD;

It's looking to be a good read, so [head over](http://canadiandad.com/ "Canadian Dad") and give him some traffic, eh?</content></entry>
