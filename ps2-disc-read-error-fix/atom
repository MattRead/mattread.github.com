&lt;blockquote cite="http://www.tweak3d.net/tutorials/hardware-repair/playstation-2-repair"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guide will walk you through the process of repairing a malfunctioning Playstation 2 or one that gives you Disc Read Errors (called "DRE" from here on). I have tested this process on two Playstation 2s now and it completely fixed the errors both were experiencing. The model # was SCPH-30001 on both units, but the process should be the same for others. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
